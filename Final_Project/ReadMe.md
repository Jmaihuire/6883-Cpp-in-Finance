## C++ Final Project


1. Use liburl to retrieve historical price data from Yahoo Finance: A function retrieves adjusted close prices for selected S&P 500 stocks and SPY into memory. "GetYahooData"

2. Create a set of Classes such as class for stock to handle EPS estimate and price information. "Stock"

3. Use member functions or independent functions for all calculation. Overload a few arithmetic operators for vector/matrix.  "Date", "YeMatrix"

4. The stocks and their corresponding price information for each group should be stored in a STL map, with stock symbol as its keys. ""

5. The AAR and CAAR for 3 groups are presented in a matrix. The row of the matrix is the group#, matrix columns are for AAR and CAAR. "Demo"

6. Use Excel Driver (strongly suggested, but gnuplot could be an alternative for Apple computers) to show the CAAR from all 3 groups in one graph.
